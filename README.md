# transformer-for-beijing-air-pollution
A transformer model in Pytorch to predict the air pollution in Beijing. I wanted to apply a transformer neural network to time series data. The result didn't satisfy me: the best RMSE I could get after I'd played with hyperparameters was only 27.5044, whereas an ESN model has given the best RMSE of 25.5611, and an LSTM one - of 22.6848.
